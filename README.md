# <span style="color: #2E86C1;"><strong>Overview of the Parking Management Project</strong></span>

This project is a smart parking management system designed and developed as part of a software engineering course. The system integrates automated vehicle identification at the entry and exit points, manages and records payments, tracks available parking spots, and provides precise guidance for vehicles within and outside the parking lot. The primary goal is to streamline and enhance the parking process for customers while providing tools for parking lot operators to upgrade their existing systems to a smart and autonomous solution.

## <span style="color: #E74C3C;"><strong>Project Summary</strong></span>

### <span style="color: #D4AC0D;"><strong>Project Goal</strong></span>
The project's primary aim was to develop a smart parking system that automates vehicle identification using cameras and license plate recognition. The system facilitates seamless parking experiences by managing entry and exit, recording payment transactions, and providing real-time parking spot availability.

### <span style="color: #9B59B6;"><strong>Key Features</strong></span>
- **Automated Vehicle Identification**: Uses cameras to recognize license plates at entry and exit points, allowing automatic gate operation.
- **Payment Management**: Supports various modern payment methods, including credit cards and mobile payment applications.
- **Parking Spot Management**: Tracks available parking spots using sensors and cameras, ensuring efficient use of space and guiding vehicles to their designated spots.
- **Pre-Booking of Parking Spots**: Allows customers to reserve parking spots in advance through an automated telephone service.
- **Vehicle Washing Service Integration**: Manages vehicle washing services within the parking lot, providing an additional convenience for customers.
- **Discount Management**: Automatically identifies eligible customers for discounts based on predefined criteria such as local residents or regular patrons.

### <span style="color: #1ABC9C;"><strong>Implementation Details</strong></span>
The system's architecture includes several innovative features to ensure optimal performance in all scenarios, including peak hours and unusual conditions. It aims to minimize human intervention in the parking process, thereby enhancing efficiency and user experience.

### <span style="color: #34495E;"><strong>Results and Conclusions</strong></span>
The implementation of the smart parking system has demonstrated significant improvements in parking efficiency, reduced environmental impact through optimized space usage, and enhanced user satisfaction by providing a smooth and secure parking experience. The project has also shown a positive influence on local businesses by increasing the time customers spend at shopping centers due to a hassle-free parking experience.

## <span style="color: #7D3C98;"><strong>Future Enhancements</strong></span>
Potential future enhancements include further integration with smart city infrastructure, expanding payment options, and improving real-time data analytics for better decision-making and resource management.
